text: Creating a place which is devoted to showing and sharing science also means making a cultural contribution in the widest sense in a society which is characterised like no other by science and by the desire to understand our world and where we come from. A design that invites visitors to find out about and actively experience themes and correlations that exist within nature, research of space and nature poses a particular challenge. For this very reason, a task of this nature demands due respect.
