text: The new information centre aims to be the central representative identification point in the overall context of the Georg-Simon-Ohm-Hochschule. Both, a high degree of aesthetics as well as the functionality of the building play a major role while reflecting the spirit of this supra-regional institution. The centre‘s programme covers a library including an open reading area, individual working spaces and several seminar and meeting facilities.
