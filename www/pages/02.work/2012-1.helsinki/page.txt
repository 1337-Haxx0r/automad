text: The proposal for the new Helsinki Central Library aims to provide a meeting place for informations, knowledge, skills and stories reflecting the creativity, innovation and interaction for the people of Helsinki. The design derives from the creation of an vertical circulation element, connecting the building by transiting from one function to another throughout the entire collection area. Which resultes in the sculptural massing of the building.
