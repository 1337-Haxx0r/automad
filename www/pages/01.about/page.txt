text: This site is just a little demo for the **Automad Content Management System**. 
To show some of the features it samples a collection of geometric shapes as [projetcs](/projects).

A project can contain **text** based data as well as **media** files.
In this case that means a rendering of the shape and a corresponding [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) article as its sample text.
